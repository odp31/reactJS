1. What is React?
- open-source, front-end javascript library that is used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications
- used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps

2. Major features
- uses virtualDOM instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive
- supports server-side rendering
- follows unidirectional data flow or data binding
- uses reusable / composable UI components to develop the view

3. What is JSX?
- XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript 
- provides "syntactic sugar" for the React.createElement() function

4. Difference between Element and Component
- element: plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components
          - can contain other Elements in their props; once created, it is never mutated 
- component: can be declared in several different ways; can be a class with a render() method, or can be defined as a function
        - either case,takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output 

8. What is state in React?
- state of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component 
- should always try to make state as simple as possible, and minimize the number of stateful components 

11. Difference between state and props
- both props and state are plain javascript objects 
- props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function

12. Why not update state directly?
- use setState() method; schedules an update to a component's state object 
- when state changes, component responds by re-rendering

16. Synthetic Events in React
- cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event 
- its API is same as the browser's native event, including stopPropagation() and preventDefault(), except the events work across all browsers 

18. what is "key" prop and what is benefit of using it in arrays of elements?
- key: special string attribute you should include when creating arrays of elements 
- key prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed 

19. What is the use of refs?
- ref is used to return a reference to the element; they should be avoided in most cases, however they can be useful when you need a direct access to the DOM element
